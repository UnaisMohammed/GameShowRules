The rules of the game are:

You must answer 15 multiple-choice questions correctly in a row to win the jackpot. 

You may quit at any time and keep the earnings. For each question, you will be 
shown the question and four possible answers in advance before deciding whether to play on or not.
 
If you do decide to offer an answer, it must be correct to stay in the game.

If at any stage, you answer incorrectly, you will have to leave the game.
